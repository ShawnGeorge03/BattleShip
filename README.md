# BattleShip
Battleship is a strategy type game where two players guess and to locate their opponents fleet of ships and sink them. 

## Setting up a Game:

Each player will take turns and get a game board that only they can see to place their 5 ships which are the following :

* Carrier, which has five holes must be placed horizontally
* Battleship, which has four holes must be placed vertically
* Cruiser, which has three holes must be placed vertically
* Submarine, which has three holes must be placed horizontally
* Destroyer, which has two holes must be placed vertically

Each ship must be placed horizontally or vertically across grid spaces—not diagonally—and the ships can't hang off the grid. Ships cannot touch each other, but they can't occupy the same grid space. You cannot change the position of the ships after the game begins. The ships will be shown as 'O' on the game board.

## Gameplay

After each ship has been placed the game will begin. Each player will take turns firing shots to hit their opponents ship starting with Player 1 then to Player 2. Make sure your shot is with in the limits of the game board else you will lose your chance to hit an enemy ship and the turn will go to them. If part of a ship is hit then an 'X' will be shown on the game board and 'M' if it is a miss. The game ends when one player has destroyed the others entire fleet.

## Future revisions

I hope that in the future to implement an simple highscore system to keep track of players on a local level of being able to finish the game with least amount of shots and implement a simple bot to be played in Single Player.
